# awesome-product-management

## A Brief Story...

I first become a Product Manager in the late 1990s in the semiconductor industry. This predated any concept (AFAIK) of Product Management being a "thing", much less a recognized discipline.

I therefore had to learn on my own. This cheat sheet is the result of many years of picking up bits of knowledge & storing them away. (If Google Keep were shareable, I would have published the raw material long before now. But I digress.) It's a simple collection of links to the topics that concern me most as a PM. >99% of the material is gleaned from other industry experts and product-centric company blogs; I've contribued a couple of Medium posts. Not many.

## Caveats 'n Stuff

* There will be considerable overlap of topics. Feel free to offer suggestions; my goal is to create smaller topic sections where doable. (See /pricing for an example.)

* Some topics (retailing, for example) are not fully populated. Feel free to make suggestions.

* Many of the links are 5+ years old - it will not surprise me if a few are dead or have moved. Next steps include cleanup whereever I can.

## TODO:

* Finish a standalone repo on Game Theory (and possibly Auction Theory) topics.
